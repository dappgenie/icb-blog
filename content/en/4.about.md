Our Journey: Building Indian Cashback

Revolutionizing Savings Since 2013

#intro
**The Evolution of Indian Cashback (ICB)**

We started IndianCashback.com in 2013 at God's Own Country, Kerala - at NIT Calicut by three college friends who envisioned revolutionizing the online shopping experience in India. At that time, shopping experiences were limited to nearby physical stores with restricted product variety, higher prices, and often poor customer service.

**Our Beginning**

When e-commerce was just beginning to blossom in India, we partnered with pioneering companies like Flipkart, Amazon, and Myntra, offering additional cashback incentives to make online shopping more rewarding.

**Reinventing the Gift Card Experience**

After establishing ourselves in the cashback industry, we identified similar issues in the gifting sector. Traditional gift-giving often results in unwanted items when the giver doesn't know the recipient's preferences. We solved this by promoting branded gift cards from popular retailers like Myntra and Westside, redeemable both online and in-store. What makes our solution unique is offering instant cashback of up to 75% on these gift cards.

**Fintech Innovation**

Today, we're integrating cashback and gift card services with fintech solutions through our partnership with Yes Bank and the launch of the ICB InstantPay RuPay Card. This innovative card offers an additional 5% cashback on top of existing offers and accelerates cashback approvals, creating unprecedented value for our customers.

**Industry-Leading Referral Program**

Our commitment to creating value extends to our referral program, offering 10% of your referred friends' transactions as real cash - not just once, but for life. This perpetual reward system demonstrates our dedication to building lasting relationships with our community.

**Join the ICB Family**

As we continue to grow and innovate, we invite you to join the millions of smart Indian shoppers who are maximizing their savings and transforming their shopping experience with Indian Cashback.
